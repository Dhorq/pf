    question: "What tools or technologies do you usually work with?",
    answer:
      "I work with tools like Python, SQL, and Excel for data tasks, and I use JavaScript, React, and Node.js for web development. I’m always open to learning new technologies if the project requires it.",

    question: "What sparked your interest in web development?",
    answer:
      "I’ve always enjoyed working with data and uncovering insights, but over time, I became more interested in building complete solutions, from the front-end interface to the back-end logic. Web development lets me bring both problem-solving and creativity together. It’s exciting to build something people can use, while still applying the structured thinking I developed from working with data.",

    question: "Have your interests always been in web development?",
    answer:
      "Not initially. I started with a strong interest in data,  I enjoyed analyzing information, finding patterns, and drawing meaningful insights using tools like Python and SQL. That analytical foundation has shaped the way I approach problems. However, over time, I found myself increasingly drawn to building things,  especially interactive websites and applications. I discovered that I really enjoy combining logic with creativity, and seeing ideas come to life in real-time through code. That’s when I realized web development and full-stack engineering were a natural next step for me. It’s not a shift away from data, but more of an expansion of my interests into building smart, impactful tools that people can actually use.",
